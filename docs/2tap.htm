<ul>
<li>Choose <i>from an audio file (WAV or similar)</i> if you sampled the tape to a WAV
file or another supported audio file format. This option is not available if the file
<i>libaudiofile-0.dll</i> is missing from the directory where <i>audiotap.exe</i> is.
<li>Choose <i>from a sound</i> if you want to record the sound right away. For this, you
need to connect the output of a tape player to the sound card input.
This option is not available if the file
<i>libportaudio-2.dll</i> is missing from the directory where
<i>audiotap.exe</i> is.
</ul>
<b>Inverted waveform</b>: some sound cards invert the signal, that is they turn negative values of the
waveform into positive ones and vice versa. If the input is such a sound card, or a .WAV
file generated with such a sound card, invalid data will come from the tape and no programs
will be converted. In these cases, check this box. In general, if the TAP file does not work,
try toggling this box and start again.<br>This option is ignored if semiwaves are selected in
the advanced options.<br>

<p>
Then press OK. You will be asked to choose the input audio file (in case you choose
conversion from an audio file) and the output TAP file (you will be able to choose whether
to create a version 0 or version 1 TAP file). When you've chosen, the conversion starts.
If the input is a sound, press play on the tape player and press <i>Cancel</i> when you want
to stop. Otherwise, wait until the end, or press <i>Cancel</i> to stop immediately.
