First of all, it is better to open the Volume Control (double click on the speaker in the
system tray), then select Options/Properties and choose "Adjust volume for Recording".
Then, select <i>Line in</i> and unselect everything else. Set the volume of <i>Line in</i>
to the maximum.

If you are recording directly, tune the volume of the tape player so the <i>Volume level</i>
bar is about 1/2 - 3/4 of the maximum. If it is too close to the maximum the sound will be
distorted.

If you are recording with a wave editor, inspect the waveform after recording. If it is a
nice and smooth sinusoid, everything should be fine.

 If it is too close to the extremes,
try lowering the volume of the tape player.

If there are irregularities in the waveform,
try to set <i>Minimum height</i> in the advanced options to a value higher than the
irregularities' height, but lower than the waveform's height. Remember that 255 is the
maximum height of the waveform.
