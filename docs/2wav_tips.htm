First of all, it is better to open the Volume Control (double click on the speaker in the
system tray), then mute everything but <i>Volume control</i> and <i>Wave</i>. Set the volume
of both to the maximum.

Connect the output of the sound card (the one normally connected to the speakers) to the
input of a tape recorder (generally marked as AUX, CD, or PHONO). Since the sound at the
recorder's input will be VERY loud, keep the volume of the recorder's speakers low.
