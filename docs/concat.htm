<BODY>
From Explorer, select one or more .TAP (or .WAV, or .DMP as generated by a DC2N
device) and drag them on the Audiotap window.<br>
You will be asked to choose the output TAP file (you will also be
able to choose the version of the TAP file, among 0, 1 or 2). When you've chosen, the
conversion starts. Wait until the end, or
press <i>Cancel</i> to stop immediately.
