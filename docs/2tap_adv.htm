<li><b>Input frequency</b>: Frequency of sound coming from sound card. As long as the frequency
is supported by the sound card, the higher, the better. 44100 Hz is strongly recommended,
because it is almost universally supported. This parameter is ignored if the input is an
audio file: in those cases, frequency will be taken form the file itself.<br>
<li><b>Minimum duration of a pulse</b>: if this value is <i>n</i>, a maximum must be at
least <i>n</i> samples after the previous minimum, and vice versa, to be considered valid. Otherwise,
the maximum and the following minimum (or vice versa) will be ignored. This can help
reduce the probability of having wrong data coming from noisy tapes. However, if this
value is too high, real triggers could be ignored.<br>
<li><b>Minimum height of a pulse</b>: this states how much a maximum must be higher than the
previous minimum, and vice versa, to be considered valid. Otherwise,
the maximum and the following minimum (or vice versa) will be ignored. 255 is the
difference between the absolute maximum and the absolute minimum.
This can help reduce the probability of having wrong data coming from noisy tapes. However, if this
value is too high, real triggers could be ignored. Recommended value is about 1/4 - 1/3
of the difference between maximums and minimums.<br>
