<li><b>Minimum distance between a max and a min</b>: if this value is <i>n</i>, a maximum must be at
least <i>n</i> samples after the previous minimum, and vice versa, to be considered valid. Otherwise,
the maximum and the following minimum (or vice versa) will be ignored. This can help
reduce the probability of having wrong data coming from noisy tapes. However, if this
value is too high, real triggers could be ignored. Default is 0.<br>
<li><b>Sensitivity (0-100)</b>: with sensitivity 0, maximums and minimums are ignored in case they
come before the trigger has fired. There can be cases, however, in which such maximums and minimums
have to be considered. If the sensitivity is > 0 but low, maximums a little below the trigger level
and minimums a little above the trigger lever will be considered as well. As the sensitivity increases,
more maximums and minimums will be considered. If the sensitivity is 100, all maximums and minimums
will be considered. It is only recommended to use high values of sensitivity with bad tapes, in
presence of sudden sound level changes, otherwise beter keep this low.<br>
<li><b>Input frequency</b>: Frequency of sound coming from sound card. As long as the frequency
is supported by the sound card, the higher, the better. 44100 Hz is strongly recommended,
because it is almost universally supported. This parameter is ignored if the input is an
audio file: in those cases, frequency will be taken form the file itself.<br>
<li><b>Machine</b>: Tell whether the tape being recorded was intended for a C64, a VIC20 or a C16/Plus 4.
This will adjust to the CPU frequency of the relevant machine. For C16, there's the option of recording
semiwaves instead of full waves.
<li><b>Video type</b>: Tell whether the tape being recorded was intended for a PAL or an NTSC machine.
This will adjust to the CPU frequency of the relevant machine.
