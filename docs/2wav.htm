<ul>
<li>Choose <i>to a WAV file</i> if you want to create a WAV file. It can be later played
back and recorded to a real tape. This option is not available if the file
<i>libaudiofile-0.dll</i> is missing from the directory where <i>audiotap.exe</i> is.
<li>Choose <i>to a sound</i> if you want to play back the sound right away. If a tape
recorder's input is connected to the sound card output, a tape can be recorded directly.
This option is not available if the file <i>libportaudio-2.dll</i> is missing
from the directory where <i>audiotap.exe</i> is.
</ul>
<b>Inverted waveform</b>: some sound cards invert the signal, that is they turn negative values of the
waveform into positive ones and vice versa. If your sound card is one of those, your Commodore will be unable to
load the tape. In these cases, check this box. If your C64 does not load the tape you recorded, try toggling
this box and start again.<br>

Then press OK. You will be asked to choose the input TAP (or DMP) file, and, in
case you choose conversionto a WAV file, the output WAV file. Wait until the
end, or press <i>Cancel</i> to stop immediately.
