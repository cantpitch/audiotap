<p>
<i>tapencoder.dll</i> implements the TAP encoder for audio data. The TAP encoding format
is a lossy compressed audio format which efficiently encodes the audio on Commodore 64
tapes. It was invented by Per H&aring;kan Sundell</b> and is described
<a href="http://www.computerbrains.com/tapformat.html">here</a>. The encoding algorithm is
by Fabrizio Gennari, derived by one made by Janne Veli Kujala, who in his turn derived it
from the one used by Andreas Matthies in Tape64.
<p>
<i>tapdecoder.dll</i> implements the TAP decoder for audio data. The algorithm for
decoding TAP data to square, sinusoidal or triangular waves is by Fabrizio Gennari.
The use of square waves was inspired by Tomaz Kac's 64TAPVOC, and confirmed after discussions
with Luigi Di Fraia.
